Issues

Css columns
Since I always use boostrap for creating grid web sites, this time I had to do some research.
I decided to use margin instead of grid.

Css responsive boxes
I tried to create responsive boxes using grid but didn't work. I use defined sizes instead.

Dynamic endpoint
I want to avoid creating an endpoint file for each cat but I don't know how to create a dynamic endpoint file. My solution was to send a parameter to the file and load the data based on the url parameter.

Responsive cat boxes
In order to show the cat info, I tried to use grid again but didn't work, so I used defined sizes again.

Responsive cat boxes
I noticed that the current css is not effective if we add more cat boxes. I solved it using flex properties.
